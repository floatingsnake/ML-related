###  Alignment 

- Map between pd and gt is arbitrary when sequence appeaers  multiple times in complex
- Greedily find permutation

###  Cross-Chain correlation

- pairwise correlation in MSA requires interacting homologs in the
  heteromeric case

- UniProt Species.

### Cropping

- memory and compute cost rapidly increase
- crop regions into contiguous blocks
